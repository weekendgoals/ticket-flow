# Run-lane lessons epic — status log

Append-only record of finished tickets. Tickets: `epics/run-lane-lessons/tickets.md`.

**Rules.** Append only. Corrections are new dated addenda beneath the entry they
correct, never edits. Report counts, not adjectives. The **Owed** line is
required even when empty.

## Baseline — 2026-09-14

Plugin at `a4f9e3b` (main). Suites: tickets 56/56, session guard 14/14,
check-invariants 11/11, board 9/9, plan-page 8/8, run-epic 91/91, codex
runner 8/8; `check-invariants.mjs` and `tickets.mjs doctor` exit 0. The run
driver halts on a fix-bounds trip (`FIX_LINE_BUDGET` 60, `STOP.fixBounds`),
the acceptance step re-runs CHECKs from the signed-off document with no rule
that a CHECK be red before its ticket, the run skill's step 1 refuses a
`done` ticket without naming a recovery, and the retro asks six questions,
none about halts. Evidence: the three weekendgoals release epics (23
tickets, 14 run records, 12 halt events: 5 plugin/environment, 4 policy, 2
plan, 1 code), their three fresh-context retro reports, and the scorecard at
https://claude.ai/code/artifact/e1f28378-4a5b-41ae-91cd-346a30404404. Known
risk: RUN-1 rests on three re-reviews that found nothing; the FND-6 case
cuts the other way and is the reversal's first data point.
